# RacingFlivverModifications

This plugin gives a short expansion to the story of Artemis Renard, the Flivver racer from Glory that the player rescues.

Upon revisitting Glory sometime after the , Artemis will contact the player, and tell them about how she's spoken with her contacts in the industry and vouched for the player to receive several custom modifications for the Racing Flivver.

Requires acquiring the Racing Flivver *after* having this plugin active, as the modifications necessitate an attribute to be added to the ship model (or you can just save edit it into the ship in your save file).
